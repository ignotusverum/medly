# Architecture

For architecture I chose to follow [event-driven architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture) and concept of [Unidirectional Data Flow](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift). Combine Framework with addition to SwiftUI is a perfect choice for such architecture to iterate fast and without the overhead.
